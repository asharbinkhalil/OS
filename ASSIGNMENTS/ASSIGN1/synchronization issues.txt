Synchronization Issue:

1- Multiple child processes accessing shared memory simultaneously.
2- Concurrent writes to a shared file may lead to conflicts and data corruption.
Resolution:

1- Implement lock variables or Semaphores for synchronization.
2- Ensure that only one child process can access the shared resource at a time.


however in our case as we only input in one of the terminal at a time there will be no issue of synchronization.
